# Landing Page Structure (Markdown)

## Hero (H1)

# Web Design + Vibe Coding for NYC Businesses That Need Results

**Subheadline (credibility + outcome):**
I help **real estate, legal, and finance teams** launch modern, high-performing websites fast—using a smart mix of **custom design**, **Framer**, and **AI-assisted builds** (without the “template” feel).

**Credibility line:**
13+ years of experience • NYC-focused • Built for speed, trust, and lead generation

**Primary CTA (button):**
**Book a Free Discovery Call**

**Secondary CTA (link):**
See how it works → (scroll to “Process”)

**Micro-trust bullets (tight + specific):**

* SEO-ready structure (technical + on-page)
* Mobile-first and lightning-fast
* Secure, compliant-friendly approach (especially for legal/finance)
* Easy updates for your team (no dev bottleneck)

---

## Social Proof Strip (immediately after hero)

**Logos (if you have them) OR category proof:**
Trusted by teams in: **Real Estate • Law • Finance • Professional Services**

**Mini proof points (choose 2–3):**

* “Cut our launch timeline in half.”
* “More qualified inquiries within 30 days.”
* “Finally a site that matches our reputation.”

*(If you don’t have testimonials yet, use a “results we optimize for” strip instead: Leads, Booked consults, Calls, Applications.)*

---

## Problem → Stakes (speak to NYC realities)

## Your website is either building trust—or leaking leads

**Short intro:**
In NYC, you’re competing with firms that look established online even if they aren’t. If your site feels slow, dated, or unclear, prospects bounce and move on.

**Pain bullets tailored to your niches:**

* **Real estate:** listings and projects look great… but the site doesn’t capture serious inquiries.
* **Legal:** you need credibility + clarity, without sounding generic.
* **Finance:** trust is everything—speed, polish, and compliance-friendly UX matter.

**Bridge to solution:**
That’s where **vibe coding** fits: modern design + fast builds + the right automation, done with senior judgment.

## What You Do (value proposition)

## A modern website, built the way NYC teams work now

**3 “pillars” (scannable):**

### 1) Premium design that looks like you belong in the room

Clean, confident visuals + messaging that matches your positioning.

### 2) Faster builds with Framer + AI (without cutting corners)

I use **Framer and AI-assisted workflows** to move quickly—while keeping quality high and the result fully custom.

### 3) Performance + SEO baked in

Fast load times, structured pages, and SEO foundations that support long-term demand generation.

*(Optional line that subtly educates buyers: “No-code isn’t ‘cheap’—it’s efficient when implemented strategically.”)*

## “Why You” (differentiate against agencies)

## Why work with me (instead of a big agency or a quick-fix freelancer)

**Positioning bullets (human tone):**

* You get **senior-level thinking** (13+ years), not a junior team learning on your budget.
* **Fast, focused execution**—without bloated timelines or endless meetings.
* The site is built to be **easy to maintain**, so your team isn’t stuck waiting for updates.
* I understand the “trust industries”: **real estate, legal, finance** need credibility and clarity—not flashy gimmicks.
